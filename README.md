## üöÄ **Getting Started**

### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**
Clone this repository to your local system:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/crud-with-laravel.git
```

### **Step 2: Install Dependencies**
Navigate to the project folder and install all required dependencies:

```

### **Step 3: Change Script Execution Policy**
If you encounter an error while running `ng serve` about script execution being disabled, follow these steps to fix it:

1. Open **PowerShell as Administrator**.
2. Run the following command to allow script execution temporarily:
   ```bash
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
   ```

3. Alternatively, set it for the current user:
   ```bash
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
   ```

## üìÅ **Code Scaffolding**

Angular CLI makes it easy to generate new components, services, or other elements. For example, to create a new component:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a full list of available schematics:
```bash
ng generate --help
```

## üì¶ **Building**

To build the project for production:

```bash
ng build
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. The production build is optimized for better performance.

---

## üß™ **Running Unit Tests**

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner:

```bash
ng test
```
